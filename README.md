## Exercise 1

**Problem:**
 
**Linked List Music Playlist**      
Create a SongNode and a LinkedList playlist.   

Each node stores:   
-title     
-artist    

Your linked list must support:   
-add_song(title, artist) → insert at end     
-delete_song(title) → delete first matching title    
-show_playlist() → numbered list           
-count_songs() → return number of tracks    

Write a program that:
1. Adds these songs:  
"Imagine" - John Lennon 
"Numb" - Linkin Park  
"Hey Jude" - The Beatles" 
2. Deletes "Numb"    
3. Prints the playlist and number of songs  

Example:

    Output:
       1. Imagine - John Lennon
       2. Hey Jude - The Beatles
       Total songs: 2
